# Machine-learning-summer-research-project-in-python
Research into detecting malware in embedded medical devices using mahine learning

These are a collection of the scripts used to conduct my summer research project on
machine learning. Some of the scripts are for collecting data from a Raspberry Pi and 
converting the data into a form the machine learning models can use. The machine learning scripts
are named after the model or there is a combined script for comparing several algorithms using data
collected by me after simulating malicious activity.
